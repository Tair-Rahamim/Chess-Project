# ♟️ Chess Project

This project is a part of the "Advanced Principles" course, which I completed as part of the Magshimim program.  
The project is written in C++ and implements core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## 📋 Project Overview
The Chess project simulates a chess game with graphical elements and follows object-oriented design patterns. It demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to manage the game's components and logic.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Run the file `chessGraphics` to initialize the graphical interface.
2. In parallel, run `main.cpp` to start the game's main logic.

Make sure both components are running simultaneously for the game to function correctly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
